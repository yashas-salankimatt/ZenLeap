/*
 * ZenLeap - Tab Navigation Styles
 *
 * All ZenLeap styles are now injected at runtime by zenleap.uc.js via
 * injectStyles().  This allows the JS to apply dynamic theme colors
 * (--zl-* custom properties) and keeps styling in a single canonical
 * source, eliminating drift between static CSS and runtime CSS.
 *
 * This file is intentionally empty.  The installer still appends it to
 * userChrome.css for backwards compatibility, but no rules are needed
 * here — the runtime #zenleap-styles element handles everything.
 *
 * If you previously customized ZenLeap colors via --zenleap-* CSS
 * variables in this file, use the built-in Settings panel instead
 * (Ctrl+Space → :settings).
